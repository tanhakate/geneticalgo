# Genetic Regression Algorithm

This is a genetic algorithm which finds the regression line for a dataset by looking for the two coefficient of the line. For our assignment, I reverse-engineered the program to determine how the genetic algorithm is implemented (what each function does step-by-step), wrote the mutation function and suggested modifications to optimize the code such as change the terminating condition, increase the population size, run the GA multiple times to watch for general trends and concatenate the results of each cycle under specific parameters together so that they will appear in the results plots.

The data file consists of an array where the columns represent temperatures taken on Apr.1 and Sept.1 from a fixed location.
